1) Write a Python program which will read the name of a directory
from the command line and print names of all files/folders etc in
that directory. Here is how you run the program:

python dirlist.py /etc

will list everything under /etc.

[Do NOT try to do stuff like using "ls" within the python program etc.
Use functions available in the "os" module]


2) Extend the program to display all FILE names in descending order
of the size of each file [hint: use os.stat]. The file size should also
be displayed along with the name.
