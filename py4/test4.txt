1) The file "q1.txt" contains some numbers, one
number per line. Each number can be written in 3 different
ways: for example:

"10" or 10 or '10'

There may be multiple blank lines between two numbers.

Write a Python script which will open this file and print the
numbers read from the file to the screen sorted in ascending order.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2) The file "q2.txt" represents a polynomial. If you check this file,
you will see:

10, 5

9, 2

12, 6

3, 5

8, 4

2, 6

28, 3

10, 0

11, 1

This file represents a polynomial, each line containg a coefficient and an
exponent. For example, the line 10, 5 represents:

10x^5 

The whole file represents:

10x^5 + 9x^2 + 12x^6 + 3x^5 + 8x^4 + 2x^6 + 28x^3 + 10 + 11x

You can combine together terms having the same exponents and write down the
polynomial like this:

13x^5 + 9x^2 + 14x^6 + 8x^4 + 28x^3 + 10 + 11x  (we will call this the "reduced form" of the polynomial)

If you write the terms in order of descending order of exponents:

14x^6 + 13x^5 + 8x^4 + 28x^3 + 9x^2 + 11x + 10

Your task is to write a Python program which will read the file "q2.txt" and print out
the equivalent polynomial in reduced form with exponents in descending order.

Your program should work with ANY polynomial, not just the one shown in q2.txt.

---------------------------------------------------------------

3) This is a modification to the above problem.


You now have a class in your program:

class Polynomial:
    ...
    ...

All the code you write will now be part of the Polynomial class - DO NOT WRITE ANY
CODE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASS, except what is described below.

The ONLY code which you will write outside the class is:

p1 = Polynomial("q2.txt") 

print p1.exponents()
# will print [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

print p1.coefficients()
# will print [14, 13, 8, 28, 9, 11, 10]

print p1
# will print 14x^6 + 13x^5 + 8x^4 + 28x^3 + 9x^2 + 11x + 10

Hint: The "__init__" function can read the file and create two fields as part of the 
polynomial object - these fields are arrays and they hold the exponent and coefficient
values.
