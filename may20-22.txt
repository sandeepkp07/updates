Sir,
 I had created a simple twitter interacting python program,2 days before.

Now,since last 2 days i had tried to edit my python program to get an updated API as per you had suggested.

I had tried it by changing OAuth version,changing text to full_text etc. but all failed.

I am very sorry to say that i was unable to spend enough time to complete the task.

I think I can finish it by the next day.

Thank you sir..
